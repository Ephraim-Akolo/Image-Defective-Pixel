# Image-Defective-Pixel
A Deep Learning Research Project that aims to Detect, Classify, and Correct Defective pixels in Smartphone images such as Dead, Hot and Stuck Pixels.

**Here are some common types of defects a Smartphone Camera might encounter:**

1. **Dead Pixels**:
Dead pixels are non-functional pixels that do not respond to changes in light or colour. They typically appear as black spots in an image.

2.  **Stuck Pixels**:
Stuck pixels are constantly "on" and do not change colour or brightness. They may appear as bright or coloured dots in an image.

3.  **Hot Pixels**:
Hot pixels consistently register as very bright, even in normal lighting conditions. They can create white or coloured spots in images.
